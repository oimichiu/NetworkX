Algorithms
    ex29.py - Krackhardt Centrality - Centrality measures of Krackhardt social network.
    ex30.py - Davis Club - Davis Southern Club Women- Shows how to make unipartite projections of the graph and compute the properties of those graphs. These data were collected by Davis et al. in the 1930s. They represent observed attendance at 14 social events by 18 Southern women. The graph is bipartite (clubs, women).
    ex31.py - RCM - Cuthill-McKee ordering of matrices. The reverse Cuthill-McKee algorithm gives a sparse matrix ordering that reduces the matrix bandwidth.
